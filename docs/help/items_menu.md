# Oggetti menu

**Item operation**

## Aggiungi

**Add a new item**

With **Oggetti > Aggiungi**, you can add an item to the tree.

-   If an item is selected, the new item is placed after the selected
    one.
-   Otherwise, the new item is placed at the last position.
-   The new item has an auto-generated title. You can change it in the
    right pane.

## Importa

**Import items from another project**

With **Oggetti > Importa**, you can import a selection of items from
another project. First you select an XML file containing the item data.
Then you select the items you want to add to the current project.

> **Hint**
> 
> To create an XML item data file for the current project, use
> **Esporta > Files dati XML**.

## Esporta descrizione oggetto per modifica

**Export an ODT document that can be imported again after editing**

With **Oggetti > Esporta descrizione oggetto per modifica**, you can create a
text document that contains item descriptions that can be edited with
*Writer* and reimported. File name suffix is `_items_tmp`.

## Esporta tabella oggetto

**Export an ODS document that can be imported again after editing**

With **Oggetti > Esporta tabella oggetto**, you can create a spreadsheet that
contains a row per item. The document can be edited with *Calc* and
reimported. File name suffix is `_itemlist_tmp`.

> **Note**
> 
> You can reorder, hide or delete columns and rows without affecting the
> reimport. Only the first column and the first row, which are hidden by
> default, must not be changed as they contain the structural information
> for the import.

## Mostra tabella in HTML

**Show an HTML report with items data**

With **Oggetti > Mostra tabella in HTML**, you can create a HTML file that
contains an item table, and launch your system's web browser for
displaying it.

> **Note**
> 
> The report is a temporary file, auto-deleted on program exit. If needed,
> you can have your web browser save or print it.

# Località menu

**Location operation**

## Aggiungi

**Add a new location**

With **Località > Aggiungi**, you can add a location to the tree.

-   If a location is selected, the new location is placed after the
    selected one.
-   Otherwise, the new location is placed at the last position.
-   The new location has an auto-generated title. You can change it in
    the right pane.

## Importa

**Import locations from another project**

With **Località > Importa**, you can import a selection of locations
from another project. First you select an XML file containing the
location data. Then you select the locations you want to add to the
current project.

> **Hint**
> 
> To create an XML location data file for the current project, use
> **Esporta > Files dati XML**.

## Esporta descrizione Località per modifica

**Export an ODT document that can be imported again after editing**

With **Oggetti > Esporta descrizione Località per modifica**, you can
create a text document that contains location descriptions that can be
edited with *Writer* and reimported. File name suffix is
`_locations_tmp`.

## Esporta tabella Località

**Export an ODS document that can be imported again after editing**

With **Oggetti > Esporta tabella Località**, you can create a spreadsheet
that contains a row per location. The document can be edited with *Calc*
and reimported. File name suffix is `_loclist_tmp`.

> **Note**
> 
> You can reorder, hide or delete columns and rows without affecting the
> reimport. Only the first column and the first row, which are hidden by
> default, must not be changed as they contain the structural information
> for the import.

## Mostra tabella in HTML

**Show an HTML report with locations data**

With **Località > Mostra tabella in HTML**, you can create a HTML file
that contains a location table, and launch your system's web browser for
displaying it.

> **Note**
> 
> The report is a temporary file, auto-deleted on program exit. If needed,
> you can have your web browser save or print it.
